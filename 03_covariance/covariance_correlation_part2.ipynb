    "# The Path to Empirical Orthogonal Function Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to continue to set the stage to use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis (or principal components analysis) on our spatiotemporal data.  Recall the we anticipate that our data will be linearly dependent - that some of our time series can be expressed as linear combinations of others.  They will covary (have a non-trivial covariance), they will be correlated (have a significant correlation coefficient), and they will not be orthogonal (they will have a non-zero dot product).  As we've said, this both provides challenges (mathematically and statistically) but also potentially reveals something about the larger-scale and perhaps causal nature of our data.  EOF analysis and related techniques will allow us to both handle the challenge and leverage the advantages of our data. \n",
